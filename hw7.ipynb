    "1. Looking at my observations in 1.4, we can see that these embeddings indicate various societal stereotypical biases:\n",
    "   * the analogy \"woman : secretary :: man : ?\" reveals systemic gender bias by connecting men with leadership roles like \"chief\" and \"president\" and women with administrative roles like \"secretary\". Similarly, the similarity score \"woman\" vs. \"man\" with \"intelligence\" (0.240 vs. 0.372) shows embeddings' stronger association of men with intelligence, reinforcing once again gender stereotypes. However, we could explain some of this bias with the word frequency in the training data, and potentially the age of the data, but these biases persist in the embeddings.\n",
    "   * on the other hand, the similarity scores \"indigenous\" vs. \"white\" with \"money\" (0.120 vs. 0.415) suggest a stronger association of \"white\" with money, reflecting economic or social disparities in the data.\n",
    "   * surprisingly, \"woman\" has a slightly stronger association with \"education\" than \"man\" (0.341 vs. 0.288), which may reflect societal narratives about women and education. However, this can oversimplify roles and contexts, ignoring men's contributions in education and reinforcing stereotypes.\n",
    "2. An example of how using these embeddings with biases could cause harm in the real world is directly if it was used in evaluating applicants for job hiring. These embeddings would indicate that all applicants who identify as \"woman\" are automatically associated with the lower leadership positions, intelligence, and education levels, when compared to the male applicants.This might influence hiring manager's decision who to hire - which would automatically reinforce decreased employee and company diversity, representation of women in certain fields, limit opportunities for women-identifying individuals, and this would further impact company's results, outcomes, and so much more, further entrenching societal stereotypes in professional environments."

    "Preprocessing is a crucial step before carrying out topic modeling and it markedly affects topic modeling results. In this exercise, you'll prepare the data using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to preprocess the `text` column in the given dataframe `df` and save the processed text in a new column called `text_pp` within the same dataframe.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`python -m spacy download en_core_web_md`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are likely to be more informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling include: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes, new-line characters, or any other non-informative characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- replacing urls, email addresses, or numbers with generic tokens such as \"URL\",  \"EMAIL\", \"NUM\". \n",

    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you finalize the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data in a CSV and work with this CSV so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n",

Say U.S.C. 922 : (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun. Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a \"person\" might also be an artificial entity that is created by government and has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what I don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional until it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, not just your run of the mill \"Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail\" Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told by the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right? \n",

      " It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard. 1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already) 2) Find the center of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere. 3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere. 4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to any of the original points. I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-) An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.\n",

I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer, comp.graphics.hw_and_sw The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day. I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or three I'm interested in. I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one meeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas, help others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there are so many different things in one meeting.
